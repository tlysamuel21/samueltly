## 🤖 AI & Data Science Projects

### 🔹 Method of Data Science – Coursework Overview

This coursework focused on supervised learning using a **real-world dataset from nanoelectrode experiments**, where the goal was to predict the **capacitance** of materials from numerical features.

#### 📌 Task 1 – Regression
- Used a dataset with 13 numerical features from nanoelectrode samples
- Built and evaluated **Random Forest** and **Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)** models
- Compared models using **MSE** and **R² scores**, with and without feature bagging
- Tuned model depth and leaf sizes using cross-validation

#### 📌 Task 2 – Classification
- Applied **k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN)** and **Logistic vs Kernel Logistic Regression**
- Explored non-linear kernels and their impact on decision boundaries

This project highlighted my skills in model building, data preprocessing, feature selection, and evaluation.
