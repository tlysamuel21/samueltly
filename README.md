## 🤖 AI & Scientific Machine Learning Projects

### 🔹 Methods for Data Science (Imperial College London)

This two-part coursework involved rigorous implementation of machine learning techniques without the use of high-level libraries like scikit-learn, focusing on both structured data and image-based scientific datasets.

#### **Coursework 1 – Supervised Learning from Scientific Data**

**Goal**: Predict electrical capacity of graphene-based electrodes and classify brain tumor types using fully custom models.

- 📊 **Regression Task**:  
  - Dataset: 558 graphene-based supercapacitor samples (12 features)  
  - Built models from scratch: **Decision Trees**, **Random Forests**, and **Gradient Boosted Trees**  
  - Implemented custom 5-fold cross-validation and evaluated models with **MSE** and **R²**  
  - Analysed feature importance using **Out-of-Bag (OOB)** estimation

- 🧠 **Multi-Layer Perceptron**:  
  - Developed a fully vectorized **2-hidden-layer MLP** in NumPy  
  - Compared optimizers: SGD, SGD with momentum, and **Nesterov’s Accelerated Gradient**  
  - Conducted convergence testing and hyperparameter tuning

- 🧪 **Classification Task**:  
  - Dataset: Brain tumor diagnosis (3-class classification)  
  - Implemented **k-NN**, **weighted k-NN**, and **2-step hierarchical k-NN**  
  - Designed and trained **logistic regression** and **kernel logistic regression** from scratch  
  - Used AUC-PR and precision/recall metrics to evaluate classifier sensitivity to minority classes

#### **Coursework 2 – Deep Learning & Manifold Learning**

**Goal**: Classify star types from telescope images and analyze geometric structure of latent feature spaces.

- 🌌 **Convolutional Neural Network for Star Classification**  
  - Dataset: 648 stellar images (Euclid telescope, 32×32 grayscale)  
  - Built a **custom CNN in PyTorch** with convolution, max-pooling, ReLU, and softmax layers  
  - Integrated **early stopping**, **L2 regularization**, and compared against class imbalance techniques:  
    - Reweighted loss  
    - Data augmentation (random rotations)

- 📉 **Dimensionality Reduction of High-Dimensional Embeddings**  
  - Reduced 180D feature vectors using:  
    - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
    - **Graph-based Isomap** with cosine distances and spectral embeddings  
  - Visualized class separability and evaluated cluster quality with the **Davies-Bouldin Index**  
  - Analyzed distance metrics: cosine vs resistance distances
